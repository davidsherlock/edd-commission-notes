Charge vendors an additional flat amount or percentage fee on each transaction.

== Description ==

**Commission Fees** for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to charge vendors an additional flat amount or percentage fee on each transaction. This allows you to offset payment processing fees, file delivery costs, as well as calculate and retain withholding tax amounts for accounting or compliancy purposes.

A fee can be either a flat rate amount or percentage-based, with the type set on a per-download basis, and rate set either globally (applied by default to all commission recipients), or overridden on a per-download or per-user basis. This allows for flexible fee structures and streamlined, granular control over your commissions.

== Use-case Examples ==

Let’s look at some real-world examples of how Commission Fees could potentially be utilised in different scenarios:

* All vendors receive 70% for each product sold on your store. To offset PayPal fees, you charge all vendors an additional $0.25 to help absorb payment processing fees.
* Some products contain large files. For these products you need to charge a higher percentage fee of 2.5% to cover Amazon S3 file delivery costs.
* One product has multiple vendors receiving commissions and you want to set their commission fees independently.

== Understanding Fees ==

To understand how the commission fee calculations work, let’s take a look at the following examples:

Flat Rate Amount: Vendor sells a $10.00 product, for which he/she receives 50% of the item price, resulting in a base commission amount of $5.00. Since we are charging all vendors a flat rate fee of $0.25, the vendor ends up with an adjusted commission amount of $4.75. The final commission amount is calculated by deducting the fee ($0.25) from the base amount ($5.00).

Percentage Fee: Vendor sells a $20.00 product, for which he/she receives 50% of the item price, resulting in a base commission amount of $10.00. Since we are charging all vendors a percentage fee of 10%, the calculated fee would be $1.00 (10 * .1), which means the vendor ends up with an adjusted commission amount of $9.00 (10 – (10 * .1)).
