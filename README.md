## [Easy Digital Downloads - Commission Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/edd-commission-notes/)

**Commission Notes** for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to record and store important notes alongside your commission records. Vendors can view the notes via the `{edd_commissions}` short code, and notes can be recorded automatically when a discount code is applied at the checkout, or when commissions are revoked.

## Use-case Examples

Letâ€™s look at some real-world examples of how Commission Notes could potentially be utilised in different scenarios:

* You want to provide your vendors with detailed information relating to how and why the commission record was revoked, including relational data such as the payment and transaction IDs.
* You want to let your vendors view when a discount code was used on an order they receive commissions for, helping them make more sense of the final amount rewarded
* You want to add a commission note when an order looks suspicious or fraudulent, giving your vendors prior warning that the commission may be revoked

## Features

* Record commission notes on a per-commission basis
* Store an unlimited number of notes on a per-commission basis
* Automatically record a note, including the payment ID, when an order is refunded
* Automatically record a note containing any discount codes used on the order where commissions were rewarded
* All notes are viewable by your vendors via a responsive, lightweight modal-box on the front-end `{edd_commissions}` short code
* Seamless integration with Easy Digital Downloads and Commissions settings
* Translation-ready and contains a POT file to help get you started translating into your own native language
* Have a specific use-case? Commission Notes includes plenty of developer-ready filters and action hooks to make it possible!
* Developed using the best practices, with security, extensibility, and readability in mind

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) and [Commissions](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/commissions/).

Commission Notes was developed with developers and third party integrations in mind, here are a few examples of how to use the `EDDC_Notes` class.

**get_notes()**

$notes = new EDDC_Notes( $commission->id );
$notes->get_notes();
~~~~

**add_note( $note = '' )**

Add a note to the commission record. Returns the new note if added successfully, false otherwise.

~~~~
$notes = new EDDC_Notes( $commission->id );
$notes->add_note( 'Hello Friend' );
~~~~

**get_notes_count()**

Get the total number of notes we have after parsing.
